# Generic Installer and Server Contract

Agent Memory Bridge is a local-first stdio MCP server. The generic installer and server contract is:

- the host or client launches `<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge` as a local subprocess
- the bridge reads JSON-RPC on `stdin`
- the bridge writes JSON-RPC on `stdout`
- every client or process sharing project memory points to one shared `AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_HOME`

Connecting a specific coding client is outside AMB Core. AMB does not discover, write, or certify Codex, Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, Cline, VS Code, or Antigravity. Clients configure stdio subprocess launching independently. The historical `v0.35.0` tag still contains the old per-client notes.

The current source/package line is `0.35.0` with exactly 17 public MCP tools. The normal install route is `pip install agent-memory-bridge`; GitHub Releases remains the publication authority for source tags and release notes. Published release availability is listed in GitHub Releases; the published v0.30.0 source archive is `https://github.com/zzhang82/Agent-Memory-Bridge/archive/refs/tags/v0.30.0.zip`. The pinned `v0.27.0` route is a historical published baseline.

## Generic Stdio Command Shape

Use the virtualenv Python as the command and `-m agent_mem_bridge` as arguments:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentMemoryBridge": {
      "command": "<venv-python>",
      "args": ["-m", "agent_mem_bridge"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_HOME": "/path/to/shared-bridge-home",
        "AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_SOURCE_CLIENT": "generic",
        "AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Point every client or process that should share this project memory at the same `AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_HOME`.

### Dockerized Stdio

If running via Docker, keep stdin open and mount a host-owned bridge home into the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_HOME=/data/agent-memory-bridge \
  -e AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_SOURCE_CLIENT=generic \
  -e AGENT_MEMORY_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  -v /path/to/bridge-home:/data/agent-memory-bridge \
  agent-memory-bridge:local
```

### Static-Schema Compatibility

Some MCP clients keep static tool schemas and may include signal-only fields on `kind="memory"` paths (for example `ttl_seconds` or `expires_at` on `store`, and `signal_status` on `recall`, `browse`, or `export`). AMB normalizes those fields at the stdio MCP boundary when `kind="memory"`, without merging the memory and signal lanes.

## Project Initialization

Initialize or resolve the project checkout using AMB's project primitives:

```bash
<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge project init .
```

`project init` detects the local Git repository, proposes a namespace such as `project:my-app`, waits for confirmation, and derives a repository baseline.

To inspect an existing binding without writing or rebinding:

```bash
<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge project resolve .
```

## Generic Lifecycle-Hook Input

AMB provides an optional lifecycle hook for hosts that wish to invoke memory recall or review candidate capture directly. It does not ship client-specific plugins or hook manifests. The host invokes the generic hook command:

```bash
<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge lifecycle-hook
```

The hook reads one generic JSON event on standard input:

```json
{
  "kind": "task_prompt",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "session_id": "session-123",
  "prompt": "How do we run tests in this repo?"
}
```

Accepted `kind` values are `session_start`, `task_prompt`, `compaction`, `ignore`, and `capture`. A normal session start resolves the bound project without dumping memory; `session_start` with `source="compact"`, and `compaction`, maintain continuity without recall. A material task prompt may recall once; an exact repeated prompt is suppressed.

`capture` may store one hidden `needs_review` candidate when `visible_artifact` is already a valid `memory.visible_artifact.v1` object and both `session_id` and `turn_id` are provided. It does not read transcripts or automatically promote candidates.

Historical write-side capture checks from the v0.35 line are documented in historical reports; they do not establish external client acceptance of the current generic hook input.

## Server Verification

Verify server installation and stdio execution with:

```bash
<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge doctor
<venv-python> -m agent_mem_bridge verify
```

`doctor` checks local prerequisites, dependencies, and configured paths. `verify` launches an isolated temporary runtime to confirm that the local stdio MCP server functions correctly. These commands verify the server itself; they do not prove that an external client loaded configuration or registered the server. Client registration is proven only when the coding client itself connects and exposes AMB's 17 public MCP tools.
